# NGINX
#
# Most Linux distributions and BSD variants have NGINX in the usual package
# repositories and they can be installed via whatever method is normally used to
# install software (apt-get on Debian, emerge on Gentoo, ports on FreeBSD, etc).
#
# Be aware that these packages are often somewhat out-of-date. If you want the
# latest features and bugfixes, itâ€™s recommended to use packages directly from
# nginx.org or build from source.
